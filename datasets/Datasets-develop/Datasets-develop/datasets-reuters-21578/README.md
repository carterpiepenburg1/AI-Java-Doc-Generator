## How to Use the Data in You App

1. Put the desired jar on the classpath of your application. This will give you access to the DAO and Bean classes.
1. Just call `init` on the DAO class you are using, passing it the path to the database files that you downloaded or generated above. When finished with the data, call `release`. The following example is for the BreastCancer dataset. For more examples see the `datasets-samples` module. 


    try {
      BreastCancerDAO.init("/usr/local/Datasets/"); // setup data
      BreastCancerDemo demo = new BreastCancerDemo();
      demo.go();
    } catch (Exception e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    } finally {
      BreastCancerDAO.release(); // release data resources
    }
